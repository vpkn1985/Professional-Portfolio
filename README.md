Enhancements Made:
Modal Implementation:
Added modals for each item in the "Experience," "Projects," "Achievements," and "Certifications" sections. Each modal is triggered by clicking the respective timeline item, list item, or certification card.
Modals contain detailed information extracted from the provided PDF, formatted with headings and paragraphs for a clean look.
Modals include a close button (&times;) and can also be closed by clicking outside the modal content.
JavaScript Functionality:
Added openModal and closeModal functions to handle the display of modals.
Included an event listener to close modals when clicking outside, enhancing user experience.
Each modal is uniquely identified (e.g., exp1, proj1, ach1, cert1) and linked to the corresponding click event.
Styling for Modals:
Styled modals with a semi-transparent background, centered content, and a smooth slide-in animation (slideIn).
Ensured modals are responsive, adjusting width on smaller screens, and include a scrollable area for long content.
Professional Touch:
Maintained the high-fidelity visuals (gradients, animations, timeline) while adding modals to provide an interactive layer.
Ensured consistency in design with the existing color scheme and typography.
This updated website now offers an interactive GUI with modals, providing a professional and user-friendly experience.
